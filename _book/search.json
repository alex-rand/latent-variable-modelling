It gives suggested workflowswhich I’ve cobbled together from a few different textbooks, and has worked examples with data from those textbooks or from open datasets I found online. When you need to do latent variable modelling for your research, you can use these workflows as a place to start.\nSpecifically, it seems like these are the sub-areas of latent variable modelling to know how to do:\n\nExploratory Factor Analysis;\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis;\nItem Response Theory;\nFull SEM;\nLongitudinal SEM\n\nMaybe I’ll discover some other types of things along the way. It’s a lifelong journey haha."

They helpfully provide all of the datasets here\nPrinciples and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling, by Kline (2011). The publisher provides data and code here\nThe lavaan documentation has some nice worked examples too.\n\nI’ll mostly be using lavaan and tidyverse, but maybe also some brms at some point.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinch, French, W.
