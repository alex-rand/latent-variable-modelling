Give a conceptual overview of latent variable modelling, especially confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).\n2. Provide workflows I've cobbled together from a few different textbooks, including examples with data from those textbooks or from open datasets I found online.\n\n## What am I referencing?\n\nThe first book on latent variable modelling I read was @gorsuch1983. This was a nice conceptual introduction, but the applied examples weren't great. I've since found a few sources with data and R code to work with. I also cite these sources throughout as I cobble together the workflows.\n\n- [_Latent Variable Modelling with R_](https://www.routledge.com/Latent-Variable-Modeling-with-R/Finch-French/p/book/9780415832458), by @Finch2015.
